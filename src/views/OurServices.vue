        Intrusion Detection Specialist: Monitors networks, computers, and
        applications in large organizations, looking for events and traffic
        indicators that signal intrusion. Determines the damage caused by
        detected intrusions, identifies how an intrusion occurred, and
        recommends safeguards against similar intrusions. Also does penetration
        testing to identify vulnerabilities and recommend safeguards as
        preemptive measures. Computer Security Incident Responder: A member of
        team that prepares for and mounts rapid response to security threats and
        attacks such as viruses and denial-of-service attacks. Source Code
        Auditor: Reviews software source code to identify potential security
        issues and vulnerabilities that could be exploited by hackers to gain
        unauthorized access to data and system resources. Virus Technician:
        analyzes newly discovered computer viruses, and designs and develops
        software to defend against them. Penetration Tester (also known as
        Ethical Hacker or Assurance Validator): Not only scans for and
        identifies vulnerabilities, but exploits them to provide hard evidence
        that they are vulnerabilities. When penetration-testing, large
        infrastructures such as power grids, utility systems, and nuclear
        facilities, large teams of penetration testers, called Red Teams, are
        employed. Vulnerability Assessor: Scans for, identifies and assesses
        vulnerabilities in IT systems including computers, networks, software
        systems, information systems, and applications software.
